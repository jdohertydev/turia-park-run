# Turia Park Run

Turia Park Run is a fully responsive website created to generate awareness of a 5k running event held monthly in the biggest park in Valencia, Spain. Everything found on this site is authentic as this is an actual fun run I currently organise myself.

The purpose of this website is to inform potential runners of the event e.g. dates, times, the meeting point, etc. as well as a call to action. In this case, it is getting the user to sign up using a form for our next race. An FAQ and gallery page provide supplementary information, which should make the decision-making process easier for the user to sign up.
